# FVTT - Prone Token

Simple module that switches a Token to an alternate 'prone' Token when the prone condition is applied.

Your prone token must reside in the same folder as the regular token and be named the same but with _prone before the extension. Example:

MyToken.png (regular token)
MyToke_prone.png (prone token)

The token will change if an effect is applied that contains the svg filename of:
- falling
- prone
- dead
- skull
- unconscious
